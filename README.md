# Modelling Mortality and Temperature in NYC
ISEF Finalist -- Research on Mortality and Temperature in NYC
<hr>
This research project was conducted in the Summer/Fall of 2017. The code, paper, poster, and some sample data are hosted here.It analyzes several decades of temperature, dew point, and mortality data from New York City, using least-squares linear regression to model future heat-related mortalities in the future. My findings show an significant and concerning increase in annual temperature-related mortalities.

Heatwaves cause significant increases in the average daily mortality of a region and thus pose a serious and growing public health risk, particularly in the context of anthropogenic climate change (Kalkstein & Greene, 1997; Kovats & Hajat, 2008; Meehl & Tebaldi, 2004). Although net winter mortality currently exceeds that of summer, rising global average temperatures will cause increases in heat-related mortality that will not be offset by declines in cold-related mortality. This study uses temperature, dew point, and mortality data from 1987 to 2000 in New York City to develop a model projecting daily temperature-related mortality anomalies and predict how climate change may affect daily mortality in the 21st century. The resulting model was run on seven general circulation models from the years 2020-2080; an analysis of the developed modelâ€™s projections shows a significant overall increase in annual temperature-related mortality, suggesting a need to address the rising risk of extreme heat caused by climate change.
