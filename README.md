# Modelling Mortality and Temperature in NYC
Heat waves, and the deadly risk they pose have become a rising global public health concern. One need only look to heat events in the past two decades: most notably, the [2003 European heat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069107003770?via%3Dihub) wave by some estimates killed 70,000 people and the [2015 Pakistan heat wave](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/heat-wave-death-toll-rises-to-2-000-in-pakistan-s-financial-hub) resulted in 20,000 deaths. Yet this issue is often overlooked by both the media and public at large. How will increasing temperatures due to climate change affect mortality in the future? This research attempts to investigate such a relationship. The research was conducted in the Summer/Fall of 2017, winning first in Earth and Environmental Sciences at the Western Nevada Science and Engineering Fair and an Intel ISEF Finalist. The code, full paper, research prsentation poster, and some sample data are hosted here. I have analyzed several decades of temperature, dew point, and mortality data from New York City, using least-squares linear regression to model future heat-related mortalities in the future. My findings demonstrate that while cold-related mortalities decrease in the future, they will be unable to compensate for a significant and concerning increase in annual heat-related mortalities.

<h1>The offical abstract:</h1>
  
Heatwaves cause significant increases in the average daily mortality of a region and thus pose a serious and growing public health risk, particularly in the context of anthropogenic climate change (Kalkstein & Greene, 1997; Kovats & Hajat, 2008; Meehl & Tebaldi, 2004). Although net winter mortality currently exceeds that of summer, rising global average temperatures will cause increases in heat-related mortality that will not be offset by declines in cold-related mortality. This study uses temperature, dew point, and mortality data from 1987 to 2000 in New York City to develop a model projecting daily temperature-related mortality anomalies and predict how climate change may affect daily mortality in the 21st century. The resulting model was run on seven general circulation models from the years 2020-2080; an analysis of the developed modelâ€™s projections shows a significant overall increase in annual temperature-related mortality, suggesting a need to address the rising risk of extreme heat caused by climate change.
